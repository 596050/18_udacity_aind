    ----------

        A list of cities specified by a tuple containing the name and the x, y
        location of the city on a grid. e.g., ("Atlanta", (585.6, 376.8))

    Attributes
    ----------
    names
    coords
    path : list
        The current path between cities as specified by the order of the city
        tuples in the list.
